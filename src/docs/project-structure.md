Project Structure and Documentation
Overview
This Vite + React project transforms a Figma dashboard into a modern, attractive web app using Tailwind CSS, React Icons (Font Awesome), React Router, and a light/dark mode toggle. It features a navigable sidebar, glassmorphism header, card-based main content, a slide-in third pane, and dedicated Settings and Profile pages. The app is responsive, animated, and deployed on Vercel.

Challenges Faced

Figma Assumptions: Generic dashboard assumed (no Figma link). Added Settings/Profile pages and theme toggle to cover potential multi-page designs.
Animations: Balanced performance with smooth transitions using Tailwind and CSS.
Mobile Sidebar: Implemented hamburger menu with slide-in animation.
Glassmorphism: Ensured cross-browser support for backdrop-blur.
Icon Library: Fixed react-icons/fa import error by ensuring proper installation.
Routing: Added React Router for multi-page navigation (Home, Settings, Profile).
Theme Toggle: Implemented light/dark mode with Tailwind dark: variants and localStorage persistence.
Light Mode Fix: Enhanced MainContent light mode with card borders and better button contrast.
Vercel Deployment: Configured vercel.json for Vite and SPA routing, deployed with GitHub integration.
